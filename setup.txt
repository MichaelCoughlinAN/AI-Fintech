START SHELL SCRIPT EXPLAINED

The included shell script is designed to run a Python script and handle interrupt signals gracefully. Let's break it down line by line:

1. `#!bin/sh`:
   - This is the shebang line. It tells the system that this script should be run with the shell interpreter (`sh`), which is a command interpreter in Unix-like systems.
   - However, there's a small typo here. Typically, the shebang line should start with `#!/bin/sh` (notice the forward slash at the beginning). Without the forward slash, the system might not be able to find the `sh` interpreter.

2. `DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd)`:
   - This line sets the variable `DIR` to the directory where the script is located.
   - `$(...)` is command substitution. It allows the output of a command to replace the command itself.
   - `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` changes the current directory to the directory where the script is located. `$0` is a special variable that contains the name of the script. `dirname` is a command that takes a pathname and returns the directory part of it.
   - After changing the directory, `pwd` (print working directory) is executed, which outputs the current directory. This output is then stored in the `DIR` variable.

3. `(trap 'kill 0' SIGINT; python3 $DIR/google_rising_trend.py )`:
   - This line runs the Python script `google_rising_trend.py` located in the directory stored in `DIR`.
   - It uses command grouping with `()` to group two commands: a `trap` command and the Python script execution.
   - `trap 'kill 0' SIGINT` is a command that traps the SIGINT signal (typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C) and then executes the command `kill 0`.
   - `kill 0` sends a SIGTERM to all processes in the current process group, effectively terminating all child processes started by the script.
   - This setup ensures that if you interrupt the script (with Ctrl+C), it not only stops the Python script but also any other processes that might have been started by it in the same process group.

In summary, this script changes to the directory where it's located, then runs a Python script, ensuring that if an interrupt signal is received (like pressing Ctrl+C), all processes started by the script are also terminated. However, remember to correct the shebang line to `#!/bin/sh` for it to work properly.
